Docker
======
If you have docker installed simply type

docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8080 "mheene/bufrvalidationdashboard"

Now open in a browser the [dashboard](http://localhost:8888/dashboard)

That's it. The dashboard runs in a tomcat container on your computer on port 8888.

You can find the image [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/mheene/bufrvalidationdashboard)

Installation
============
The directory Servlet-Version contains the BUFR Validation Dashboard.

Copy the file build.properties-template to build.properties and change the content to your local installation.
At least you need to change catalina.home to your local installation. If you need a proxy to acces the internet configure the proxy setting in file /web/WEB-INF/web.xml


Create Distribution
===================
Simply type

ant dist

and you will find the distribution in the directory dist. If you run tomcat and changed in the build.properties the variable catalina.home then

ant deploy

will deploy the application.
